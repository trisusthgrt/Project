and distinct plumage patterns . Most wild budgerigars have a yellow forehead (juveniles have a barred forehead), a yellow and black striped head with purple and black markings on the cheeks,
a pointed bill whose tip of the upper mandible extends over the lower mandible, and a yellow throat.

Life span :5 to 8 years
